// Angel also includes facilities to make testing easier.

// `package:angel_test` ships a client that can test

// Tests do not require your server to actually be mounted on a port,
// so they will run faster than they would in other frameworks, where you
// would have to first bind a socket, and then account for network latency.
//
// See the documentation here:
// https://github.com/angel-dart/test
//
// If you are unfamiliar with Dart's advanced testing library, you can read up
// here:
// https://github.com/dart-lang/test
